# FoodHub Recipe Site

## Project Description
This project is a Recipe Finder and Manager web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Our team developed this application to help users find recipes based on specific ingredients. Users can search for recipes, mark their favorites, and leave comments on the recipe pages. The application integrates an external API to provide a wide range of recipe ideas and includes a visually appealing design for an enhanced user experience.
